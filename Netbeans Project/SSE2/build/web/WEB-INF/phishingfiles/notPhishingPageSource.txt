The Nuances:
Finding the difference between two dates isn't as straightforward as subtracting the two dates and dividing the result by (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000). Infact, its erroneous!

For example: The difference between the two dates 03/24/2007 and 03/25/2007 should be 1 day; However, using the above method, in the UK, you'll get 0 days!

See for yourself (code below). Going the milliseconds way will lead to rounding off errors and they become most evident once you have a little thing like Daylight Savings Time come into the picture.

OUTPUT:
Manual - Days between: 01-Jan-2007 and 02-Jan-2007 is: 1
Calendar - Days between: 01-Jan-2007 and 02-Jan-2007 is: 1
